                <span class="spring-journal">Having spent six warm, and some would argue hot, years in Hong Kong, I
                    ventured to Pittsburgh to embark on my graduate studies. Though I hail from a northern Chinese city,
                    the cold has always been a source of trepidation for me. The climate in Hong Kong was perfectly
                    suited to my liking, so I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious about the weather in my new home. I
                    had heard rumors that the snow would start falling as early as November, and winter would drag on
                    until April. Fearing the worst, I stocked up on two down jackets, two pairs of winter boots, and an
                    array of hats, gloves, and scarves to see me through the impending winter months.</span>

                <span class="architecture-journal">As someone who dedicated seven years of youth to architecture, from
                    the age of 18 to 25, even though I now dislike this industry after starting my career, I cannot deny
                    that my love for the aesthetics of construction still manifests in my daily life. For instance, I
                    obsessively photograph the little houses on the streets near my apartment! One friend joked with me,
                    saying, ’The poorest people living in these houses near your apartment are probably professors.‘
                    This demonstrates the affluence of the area.</span>

                    skyscrapers, and I suddenly felt like I had 'entered the city'. </span>
