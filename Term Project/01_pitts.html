                <span class="spring-journal">After living in the tropical city of Hong Kong for six years, I found
                    myself in Pittsburgh, a northern city on the east coast of the United States. I thought I would have
                    a hard time adjusting, but to my surprise, the climate here is much more comfortable than I had
                    anticipated. I especially love the spring season here - starting from March, the weather gradually
                    warms up day by day. Sometimes, it can go from below freezing, requiring a down jacket one day, to
                    nearly 20 degrees Celsius, allowing for short-sleeves and skirts the next.</span>
